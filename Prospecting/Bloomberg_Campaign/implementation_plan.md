# Campaign Plan: Dick's Sporting Goods - AWX/Azure to AAP

## Goal
Target Dick's Sporting Goods technology teams, specifically those using AWX, Ansible Open Source, and Azure, to position Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) as the enterprise solution.

## User Review Required
- Review proposed personas and messaging tone.

## Proposed Strategy

### Phase 1: Research & Discovery - [x]
- **Findings**:
    - **Cloud**: Heavy investment in Microsoft Azure, Azure Arc, and AKS.
    - **Data**: Confluent (Kafka) for real-time data.
    - **DevOps**: Confirmed usage of Ansible in job descriptions ("Senior Systems Engineer - DevOps and Automation").
    - **Gap**: No explicit public mention of AAP, suggesting potential AWX or CLI usage.

### Phase 2: Persona Development
- **Persona 1: "The Cloud & Scale Architect"**
    - **Role**: Cloud Architect / Principal DevOps Engineer
    - **Focus**: Integrating Azure Arc with automation, managing hybrid cloud for retail stores.
    - **Pain Point**: "How do I manage configuration drift across thousands of stores using Azure?"
- **Persona 2: "The Automation Lead"**
    - **Role**: Senior Systems Engineer - DevOps
    - **Focus**: Writing Ansible playbooks, CI/CD pipelines.
    - **Pain Point**: Scaling open source tools (likely AWX) without enterprise support; lack of role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Persona 3: "The Retail Ops Director"**
    - **Role**: Director of Infrastructure / IT Operations
    - **Focus**: Uptime during peak seasons, security compliance (PCI).
    - **Pain Point**: "Is our automation secure and auditable?"

### Phase 3: Content Creation
- **Deliverables**:
    - **Email Sequence**: 3-touch sequence focusing on "From AWX to Enterprise AI-driven Automation".
    - **One-Pager**: "Ansible Automation Platform + Microsoft Azure: Better Together".
- **Key Value Props**:
    - **Azure Integration**: Native integration with Azure connectivity and inventory.
    - **Event-Driven Ansible**: Reacting to Kafka (Confluent) events for real-time remediation.
    - **Security**: Hardened automation for retail compliance.

## Verification
- User review of the generated personas and email drafts.
