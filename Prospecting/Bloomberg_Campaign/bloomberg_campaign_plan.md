# Campaign Plan: Bloomberg - Unifying Automation

## Goal
Position Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) as the centralized "outcome-based" automation layer to unify Bloomberg's fragmented landscape (Chef, Salt, Ansible-core, Bladelogic).

## User Review Required
- Review persona angles and tone.

## Proposed Strategy

### Phase 1: Research - [x]
- **Findings**:
    - **Infrastructure**: "Infrastructure Automation Engineer" roles confirm broad use of Ansible and Chef.
    - **Modernization**: B-PIPE moving to AWS/Azure suggests a hybrid strategy, needing effective cloud automation.
    - **Legacy**: Bladelogic (TrueSight) likely maintaining on-prem legacy systems; migration trends point to "modernize or cap-and-grow".
    - **Opportunity**: Fragmentation is the enemy. Positioning AAP as the "unifier" that doesn't require immediate rip-and-replace of salt/chef but orchestrates them.

### Phase 2: Persona Segmentation
- **Persona 1: The "Cloud Acceleration" Lead (B-PIPE/Market Data)**
    - **Context**: Moving B-PIPE to public cloud (AWS/Azure).
    - **Pain**: "Salt/Chef don't handle cloud-native event-driven workflows well."
    - **Pitch**: AAP as the bridge between legacy on-prem data centers and new AWS/Azure regions.
- **Persona 2: The "Platform Engineering" Manager**
    - **Context**: Hiring for general "Automation Engineers" with mixed skills.
    - **Pain**: "I can't hire enough people who know Bladelogic AND Chef AND Salt."
    - **Pitch**: Standardization on Ansible (YAML) lowers the barrier to entry for new hires compared to Ruby (Chef) or proprietary scripts.
- **Persona 3: The CISO / Compliance Director**
    - **Context**: Financial data requires strict audit trails.
    - **Pain**: "How do I prove who ran what across 4 different tools?"
    - **Pitch**: AAP Automation Mesh + Analytics = One Audit Log for everything.

### Phase 3: Content Creation
- **Deliverables**:
    - **Email Sequence**:
        - Email 1: The "Unification" Pitch (General Engineering)
        - Email 2: The "Talent/Scaling" Pitch (Management)
        - Email 3: The "Compliance/Audit" Pitch (Leadership)
    - **LinkedIn InMail**: Short, punchy "Did you know you can orchestrate Chef with Ansible?" hooks.

### Phase 3: Content Creation
- **Deliverables**:
    - Targeted Email Templates A/B testing "Rip and Replace" vs "Wrap and Extend".
    - LinkedIn InMail scripts.
    - "Why AAP?" one-pager specifically comparing Chef/Salt maintenance vs AAP.

## Verification
- User review of drafted content.
