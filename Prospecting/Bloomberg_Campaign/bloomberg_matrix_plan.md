# Campaign Plan: Bloomberg Networking & Legacy x86

## Goal
Convert two key contacts—**Ranga Sam** (Network/Ansible Workshop) and **Richard McLeod** (Homegrown x86 Automation)—into champions for an enterprise AAP deal, leveraging a matrix sales team.

## User Review Required
- Review the "Matrix Engagement Model" to ensure it aligns with your internal sales structure.

## Proposed Strategy

### Phase 1: The "Matrix" Map (Internal)
- **Junior AE (The QB)**: Orchestrates the play. Owns the relationship and rhythm.
- **Account Solution Architect (The Tech)**: Validate Ranga's workshop learnings; Challenge Richard's homegrown code.
- **Sales Specialist (The Closer)**: Build the ROI case (Buy vs Build) for leadership.

### Phase 2: Targeted Outreach
- **Target 1: Ranga Sam (Networking)**
    - **Context**: Attended Ansible Networking Workshop. Knows the basics.
    - **Action**: "Workshop Follow-up" -> "Custom Demo" (bring the SA).
- **Target 2: Richard McLeod (x86 / Homegrown)**
    - **Context**: Built his own automation. Likely proud of it but drowning in maintenance.
    - **Action**: "Maintainer fatigue" -> "Platform scale" (bring the Specialist).

### Phase 3: Deliverables
- **Sales Journey Map**: Weekly cadence for the Junior AE.
- **Content**: Extremely specific emails referencing "Network Workshop" and "Homegrown Platform".
- **README**: Index of all assets.

## Verification
- User review of the sales journey and email drafts.
