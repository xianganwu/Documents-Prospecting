# Bloomberg Matrix Sales Campaign: Networking & x86

## The Matrix "Team" Structure
This campaign is designed for an AE to "quarterback" a larger team. You are not expected to close the deal alone.
*   **AE (You)**: The "Door Opener." You own the relationship, the scheduling, and the follow-up. You find the pain.
*   **Account Solution Architect (Account SA)**: The "Technical Validator." They prove that AAP is better than homegrown scripts. They handle the "how".
*   **Sales Specialist**: The "Business Case Builder." They prove the ROI to management. They handle the "why".

## The Journey Map (6-Week Sprints)

| Week | Phase | Activity (AE Action) | Resource Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Re-Engagement** | Send "Workshop Follow-up" email to Ranga. Send "Maintenance Burden" email to Richard. | None |
| **2** | **Discovery** | Goal: Book a 30-min "Discovery Call". Ask about "Day 2" costs of their current tools. | None |
| **3** | **Validation** | **Meeting 1**: Bring Account SA to demo "Event-Driven Ansible" for Ranga. | **Account SA** |
| **4** | **Expansion** | **Meeting 2**: Bring Sales Specialist to discuss "Enterprise Support" vs "Homegrown" risks with Richard. | **Sales Specialist** |
| **5** | **Proposal** | Draft a "Buy vs Build" ROI one-pager based on findings. | Sales Specialist |
| **6** | **Close/Next Steps**| Push for a Proof of Value (POV) agreement. | Account SA + Specialist |

## Targeted Content needed for the AE

### 1. Target: Ranga Sam (Security/NetOps)
*   **Context:** Confirmed title: *IT Security Architect*. Attended Ansible Networking Workshop.
*   **Pain Point:** Scaling network security (firewalls, policy) without manual config errors.
*   **Angle:** "You saw the basics in the workshop. Now let's apply it to your Security Architecture."

**Email Template: The "Workshop" Hook**
> **Subject:** Following up on the Ansible Networking Workshop / Bloomberg Security
>
> Hi Ranga,
>
> It was great to have you at the recent Ansible Networking Workshop.
>
> I see you’re leading Security Architecture at Bloomberg now. A common piece of feedback we hear from workshop attendees is: *"The labs were great, but how do I apply this to complex security policies at scale?"*
>
> I’d love to introduce you to our Account Solution Architect, [SA Name]. They specialize in **Security Policy as Code**—basically taking the concepts you saw in the workshop and applying them to firewalls/IDPS for automated compliance.
>
> Do you have 15 minutes next Tuesday to discuss how AAP can automate the security verification layer?
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]

### 2. Target: Richard McLeod (x86 / Homegrown Ops)
*   **Context:** Runs a custom Homegrown platform for x86.
*   **Pain Point:** "Maintenance Debt." He is likely the "bottleneck" because only he knows how the code works. If he leaves, Bloomberg is at risk.
*   **Angle:** "AAP isn't replacing you; it's scaling you."

**Email Template: The "Homegrown" Hook**
> **Subject:** The hidden cost of "Homegrown" x86 automation
>
> Hi Richard,
>
> I understand you’ve built a robust custom automation platform for Bloomberg's x86 fleet. That’s an impressive feat.
>
> However, many engineering leaders I speak with eventually hit a "maintainer's wall"—where they spend more time patching their own automation tool than innovating for the business.
>
> We often work with architects in your position to transition from "Homegrown" to **Enterprise Supported**.
>
> *   **Remove the Bus Factor:** Standardize on Ansible Automation Platform so the broader team can contribute (YAML vs Custom Code).
> *   **Enterprise Support:** When the platform breaks at 2 AM, call Red Hat, don't wake up yourself.
>
> Would you be open to a "Buy vs Build" discussion with our automation specialist?
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]

## Internal Handoff Notes (For the AE)
*   **To the SA:** "Ranga is technical. He knows Ansible basics. Don't show him 'Hello World'. Show him 'Zero Trust Automation' or 'Automated Firewall Compliance'."
*   **To the Specialist:** "Richard is proud of his tool. Don't call it 'legacy'. Call it 'bespoke'. We are here to help him *scale* his impact, not delete his work."
