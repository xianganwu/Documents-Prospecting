# Bloomberg Campaign Assets - README

## Overview
This folder contains a complete sales campaign package for penetrating Bloomberg's Engineering and Operations teams with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP).

## 1. General Campaign (The "Orchestrator" Strategy)
*   **[bloomberg_campaign_plan.md](bloomberg_campaign_plan.md)**: High-level strategy to position AAP as the "Orchestrator of Orchestrators" managing Chef/Salt/Bladelogic.
*   **[bloomberg_campaign_content.md](bloomberg_campaign_content.md)**: Email sequences and LinkedIn scripts targeting Cloud Leads, Platform Managers, and Security Directors.
*   **[bloomberg_value_prop.md](bloomberg_value_prop.md)**: A "One-Pager" comparison document detailing the technical and business value of AAP vs. Bloomberg's specific legacy stack.
*   **[bloomberg_prospect_list.md](bloomberg_prospect_list.md)**: A list of high-value targets including Adam Wolf (Head of Eng) and Phil Vachon (Head of Infra).

## 2. Specialized "Matrix" Campaign (Networking & x86)
*Targeting Ranga Sam and Richard McLeod*
*   **[bloomberg_networking_x86_journey.md](bloomberg_networking_x86_journey.md)**: A detailed "Journey Map" for an Account Executive.
    *   Includes specific 6-week engagement timeline.
    *   Defines roles for Account SA vs. Sales Specialist.
    *   Contains highly tailored email scripts for Ranga (Network Workshop Follow-up) and Richard (Homegrown Platform Migration).

## How to Use
1.  **Start with the General Campaign** to build broad awareness across the disjointed engineering teams.
2.  **Use the Specialized Journey** for immediate, tactical entry points with known contacts (Ranga/Richard).
3.  **Leverage the 'One-Pager'** as a leave-behind asset after every meeting to handle objections about "Why not just use Chef?".
