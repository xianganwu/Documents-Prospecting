# EPAM Ansible Campaign Strategy

## 1. Executive Summary
EPAM is a leading digital transformation services and product engineering company. Our goal is to position Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) not just as an IT tool, but as a strategic enabler for their core business: **delivering high-quality digital solutions to their clients faster and more efficiently.**

## 2. Target Personas

### A. The "Business of Engineering" Leader (e.g., VP of Engineering, Head of Delivery)
*   **Focus:** Margins, delivery velocity, standardization across client projects, talent retention.
*   **Pain Points:** 
    *   Inconsistent tooling across projects leading to "snowflake" deployments.
    *   Time wasted on repetitive infrastructure setup instead of value-add coding.
    *   Difficulty demonstrating compliance/security to enterprise clients.
*   **Value Prop:** AAP provides a standardized "Automation Factory" that can be replicated across client engagements, reducing startup time and ensuring consistent quality.

### B. The Platform Strategy Leader (e.g., Head of Cloud Center of Excellence, Chief Architect)
*   **Focus:** Scalable architecture, multi-cloud management, reducing technical debt.
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   Managing diverse client environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem) with fragmented tools.
    *   Lack of visibility into what resources are being consumed.
*   **Value Prop:** AAP acts as the "glue" (orchestrator) across hybrid clouds, dealing with complexity so their teams don't have to manually intervene.

### C. The Practice Lead (e.g., DevOps Practice Lead, Intelligent Automation Lead)
*   **Focus:** Tooling best practices, upskilling teams, operational efficiency.
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   Staff burnout from manual toil.
    *   Keeping up with the latest tech stack requests from clients.
*   **Value Prop:** "Write once, run anywhere" automation. AAP allows them to build a library of certified automations (e.g., "SAP Build", "Cloud Landing Zone") that any team can consume.

## 3. Business Critical Use Cases

### Focus Area 1: "Automation as a Service" for Client Delivery (Revenue Engine)
*   **Concept:** EPAM builds a catalog of standard automation assets (Playbooks) that they "sell" or "include" in every engagement.
*   **Outcome:** 
    *   **Faster Project Kickoff:** Spin up client environments in hours, not weeks.
    *   **Higher Margins:** Less manual labor needed for Day 0/Day 1 tasks.
    *   **Differentiation:** EPAM shows clients they are "automation-first."

### Focus Area 2: Internal Operational Efficiency (Cost Reduction)
*   **Concept:** Automating EPAM's own internal IT and developer platforms.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   **Self-Service IT:** Developers get resources via a portal (ServiceNow + AAP) without waiting associated with tickets.
    *   **Security & Compliance:** Automated patching and drift detection across internal systems.

## 4. Key Messaging Pillars

1.  **Standardization at Scale:** "Stop reinventing the wheel for every client. Build a library of automation assets."
2.  **Governance & Security:** "Give your clients peace of mind with auditable, secure automation execution."
3.  **The Force Multiplier:** "Enable your junior engineers to perform senior-level tasks through push-button automation."
