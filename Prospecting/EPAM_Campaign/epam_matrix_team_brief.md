# EPAM Extended Matrix Team Brief

## 1. Mission Statement
To penetrate EPAM's key delivery and practice units, positioning Ansible Automation Platform as the standard for **client delivery acceleration** and **internal operational excellence**.

## 2. Why EPAM?
EPAM is a powerhouse in product engineering. They are under pressure to deliver digital platforms to their clients faster and more securely. Ansible is likely already being used by their engineers in "community" versions. Our opportunity is to upgrade them to a standardized, enterprise-grade platform (AAP) that they can monetize or use to improve their own margins.

## 3. Team Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility | Key Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Account Executive (Lead)** | Overall strategy, commercial negotiations, relationship mapping. | Coordinates all outreach; "Quarterback" of the deal. |
| **Ansible Specialist (You)** | Use case development, value messaging, connecting business outcomes to tech. | Leads "Why Ansible?" presentations; drafts strategic content. |
| **Solution Architect** | Technical validation, demonstrations, architecture design. | Leads "How it technical works" sessions; PoC execution. |
| **Partner Manager** | Aligning with key ecosystem partners (e.g., AWS, Microsoft) where EPAM is active. | Identifies co-sell opportunities with Cloud Providers. |

## 4. Rules of Engagement within EPAM
*   **Coordinate First:** Do not reach out to key contacts without checking with the core account team. EPAM is a relationship-heavy account.
*   **Listen for "Client Delivery":** If an EPAM contact talks about a "client project," that is a potential sell-with or sell-through opportunity.
*   **Don't sell "Tools", sell "Outcomes":** Avoid feature dumping. Focus on margin, speed, and risk reduction.

## 5. The "Elevator Pitch" for the Matrix Team
>"We aren't just trying to sell EPAM another software license. We want to help EPAM build an 'Automation Factory' that allows your delivery teams to spin up client environments in minutes, not days. This improves your project margins and gives your clients a more secure, standardized result. Let's talk about how AAP can become a competitive differentiator for your bids."
