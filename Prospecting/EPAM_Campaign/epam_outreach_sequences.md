# EPAM Outreach Sequences

## Sequence A: Executive Leadership
**Target:** VP of Engineering, Head of Delivery, Head of Cloud
**Theme:** Strategic Business Value (Margins, Velocity, Differentiation)

### Email 1: The "Automation Factory" Concept
**Subject:** Accelerating EPAM's Client Delivery with an Automation Factory

Hi {{First Name}},

Observing EPAM's impressive growth in [Specific Area, e.g., Cloud Modernization], I imagine a key challenge is maintaining high delivery velocity while ensuring standardization across diverse client environments.

At Red Hat, we're seeing top systems integrators shift from ad-hoc scripting to building centralized "Automation Factories."

**The value for EPAM?**
*   **Higher Margins:** Reduce non-billable setup time for client projects.
*   **Standardization:** "Write once, deploy anywhere" assets for major platforms (AWS, Azure, SAP).
*   **Security:** Auditable automation that helps you meet strict client compliance requirements effortlessly.

I’d welcome a brief dialogue on how AAP could underpin this strategy for your practice.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Email 2: Follow-up / Client Outcome
**Subject:** Re: Accelerating EPAM's Client Delivery

Hi {{First Name}},

Building on my previous note—imagine if your delivery teams could provision a fully compliant, "Day 1" ready environment for a new client in 30 minutes instead of 3 days.

That's the power of the Ansible Automation Platform. It’s not just a config tool; it’s an orchestrator that glues together the complex tools your teams use (Terraform, ServiceNow, Cloud Native services).

Are you open to a 15-minute sync next Tuesday to discuss how this impacts project margins?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Sequence B: Technical Leadership / Practice Leads
**Target:** DevOps Practice Lead, Chief Architect, Head of Intelligent Automation
**Theme:** Efficiency, Scaling, Reducing Tech Debt

### Email 1: From Scripts to Strategy
**Subject:** Scaling EPAM's DevOps Practice

Hi {{First Name}},

I know your teams are experts at using the best tools for the job. Often, that means a lot of Python, Bash, and community Ansible scripts spread across hundreds of repos.

We're helping practice leads consolidate this "automation sprawl" into a governed, self-service catalog.

**Why consider Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)?**
1.  **Governance:** Know exactly who ran what automation, where, and when.
2.  **Scalability:** Run automation across hybrid clouds without managing the execution environment yourself.
3.  **Self-Service:** Enable L1 support or even non-technical teams to run complex workflows safely.

Is this a gap you're looking to bridge this quarter?

Best,
[Your Name]
