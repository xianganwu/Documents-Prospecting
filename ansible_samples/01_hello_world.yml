# 01_hello_world.yml
# This playbook is a simple starting point to verify connectivity to your managed nodes.
# It uses the 'ping' module, which doesn't actually use ICMP ping, but checks if
# Ansible can connect and execute python on the target.

- name: Hello World - Connectivity Check
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false # Skipped for speed in this simple test

  tasks:
    - name: Ping the remote host

      # The ping module returns "pong" on success.
