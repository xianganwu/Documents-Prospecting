1. CURRENT STATE AND BUSINESS OBJECTIVES
Red Hat has been a longstanding partner with Norfolk Southern, collaborating on Linux, HPC environments, and more. Initially, Norfolk Southern sought to cut capital and operational costs by adopting Red Hat's open-source subscription model, replacing expensive proprietary software stacks that demanded hefty upfront investments in licensing. With the absence of upfront license fees, the scalability of open-source software aligns with subscription models, offering a flexible purchasing approach.
The partnership has not only yielded considerable savings but has also extended to collaboration on Norfolk Southern's Container Platform, Release Engineering, and Development teams for containerization and platform implementation. In recent years, Red Hat's role has evolved beyond cost savings, delving into the heart of innovation within the open-source development model, particularly for emerging cloud technologies. The maturity of this model has enabled Red Hat to deliver cloud and management solutions that not only drive business value but also enhance application time-to-market and operational support efficiency.
However, recent support incidents have underscored the need to enhance the resiliency, governance, and controls of Norfolk Southern's Container Platform Service and surrounding infrastructure, which hosts critical business applications. Despite external factors causing the incident in question, it resulted in service disruptions for customers relying on applications hosted on the platform, emphasizing the potential impact on train operations with extended unavailability.
In response, Red Hat proposes improvements in three critical areas:
1. Service Resiliency and Reliability Risks
The current resiliency approach involves a full disaster recovery (DR) migration impacting all applications, proving time-consuming, resource-intensive, and error-prone. This proposal aims to offer more efficient options to minimize business impact and risk.
2. Governance and Accountability Risks
An outdated Configuration Management Database (CMDB) hinders risk analysis and identification of single points of failure. This proposal seeks to update the CMDB for improved visibility, traceability, and accurate Mean Time to Identification and Mean Time to Recovery.
3. Standardization and Repeatability Risks
Procedural updates reliant on individual knowledge pose risks of misconfiguration and inconsistency. Red Hat proposes enforcing standardized processes for greater reliability, reducing the potential impact of errors, and ensuring consistent performance aligned with Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
________________


Advancements in these key areas will lead to project goals summarized below and detailed later in this document. What we know to be important to Norfolk Southern and the desired outcome of this implementation would be the following:
* Resilient Workload Placement: Streamline the process for customers to determine optimal workload placement for peak performance and to facilitate the adoption/integration of current technology.
* Reduce Risk Within Operations: Simplify and enhance day-to-day operations for staff, minimizing risks in provisioning, patching, and ongoing upgrades. Aim to decrease the blast radius when incidents occur.
* Accelerate CMDB Maturity: Establish a robust process for maturing an enterprise Configuration Management Database (CMDB). Develop a long-term strategy for consistent updates to track all changes, aligning with evolving legal requirements.
* Create Automated Controls and Governance: Enable effective controls and governance to mitigate operational risks while maintaining a rapid pace in delivering essential business functionality.
* Scaling to Dynamic Business Needs: Enhance scalability to align with fluctuating business demands and optimize spending accordingly.
* Framework Definition: Define a robust framework through guidance, architectural support, and hands-on consulting. Ensure that any *as-a-Service environment delivers long-term value and remains supportable through future upgrades and updates.
* Accelerate Time-to-Market: Provide resources to significantly reduce the time it takes to turn ideas into results. Leverage cutting-edge technology and methodologies for both stateful and ephemeral workloads, enabling researchers to embrace innovation.

4. Resilient Workload Placement within The Application Platform Service

The recent support incidents underscore the critical need to enhance the resilience, governance, and controls of Norfolk Southern's Container Platform Service, which hosts vital business applications. We've discovered that the applications on this platform play a pivotal role in train operations, and any unavailability could lead to disruptive train stoppages. Quantifying the cost of such stoppages is challenging.


Business Impact (Governance, Resilience, & Stability)
	Recommended Services
	To mitigate this risk, Red Hat recommends implementing a platform operating model for the OpenShift environment. This model focuses on three key areas:
Service Resiliency and Reliability: Currently, the sole resiliency option involves a full disaster recovery (DR) migration, impacting all applications in the environment. This approach is time-consuming, resource-intensive, error-prone, and escalates business impact and risk across all hosted applications. A more effective strategy is needed.
Governance and Accountability: The Configuration Management Database (CMDB) documenting platform integrations and relationships is outdated, hampering accurate risk analysis and identification of single points of failure. The lack of visibility and traceability of platform changes negatively affects the Mean Time to Identification and Mean Time to Recovery. Updating the CMDB is crucial for informed decision-making.
Standardization and Repeatability: Current procedural updates to systems, infrastructure, and configurations rely on "tribal knowledge," posing a significant risk of misconfiguration due to human error. The absence of standardized processes, tested and validated, exacerbates inconsistency across the environment. An incomplete CMDB and reliance on individual expertise increase the risk of typos impacting mission-critical applications. Moreover, variations in configurations for similar application architectures lead to unexpected performance behaviors and potential outages, contrary to expected SLAs.
Implementing a robust platform operating model will address these issues, enhance overall reliability, and fortify Norfolk Southern's Container Platform Service against potential disruptions.

6. RED HAT RECOMMENDATIONS
Implement resiliency, reliability, and stability plans at Norfolk Southern (On-Prem, in the Cloud, at the Edge). Based on Red Hat’s current knowledge of Norfolk Southern’s environment and procedures, Red Hat has the following recommendations to minimize or mitigate the risks identified above.l


1. Service Resiliency and Reliability Recommendation
The Container Platform Environment hosts a variety of workloads, some being mission-critical with strict availability requirements, while others may have more relaxed availability requirements. To fulfill the service availability requirements, Red Hat recommends the following approach.
Gold Level Service is provided by two or more production OpenShift clusters acting in concert to provide a single logical platform to the application users.  The objective is to have multiple clusters of a smaller size so that no single cluster being offline for any reason will impact business operations.  The configuration and management of these individual clusters would be automated and governed centrally (via Red Hat’s Advanced Cluster Management and Advanced Cluster Security).   An example is below:  
________________




2. Governance and Accountability Recommendation
Implementation of the Service Resiliency and Reliability recommendations will go a long way to addressing the governance and accountability for the Container Application Platform environments.  All modifications will be done through automation (provided as part of ACM), and there will be change logs and audit trails for any changes made.  The Declarative State approach of ACM (you specify what the environment should look like, and the platform makes the appropriate changes and manages configuration drift) ensures that the system is always configured per the design specifications.
For systems outside of the scope of control (such as external Virtual Machines or other infrastructure) that require a procedural approach to configuration, the recommendation is to follow a similar approach, but Ansible Automation Platform does the configuration based on specifications stored in a central repository.  That way, any modifications to a platform are tracked, and there is an audit trail to identify any changes made.  As part of any modification, an automatic update of the CMDB would be done as well.
3. Standardization and Repeatability Recommendation
Both of the items above will result in standardization and repeatability across the environment.  NS will have an up-to-date CMDB, as well as the ability to quickly create/recreate Container Platform environments as needed (both on-premise as well as in the cloud)
________________
7. INVESTMENT & RETURN CONSIDERATIONS
Assessing the financial impact of adopting these proposals is challenging. However, we've discovered that the apps operating on the Container Platform Service are vital for train operations. Any downtime could potentially halt trains. In addition to mitigating this risk, implementing these recommendations would enhance operational efficiency through improved problem detection and resolution times, reduce manual labor, and decrease the frequency of rework and system outages.
Most of the necessary Red Hat components for these improvements are already owned by Norfolk Southern. However, a few additional components would be required to expand and further NS business resilience:
* Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus Upgrade: This upgrade is crucial for efficiently managing multiple OpenShift clusters in a standardized way, and enabling what is known as "fleet management". This visibility is essential for identifying potential disruptions, such as delays or route changes, and enabling proactive decision-making to maintain operational continuity.
* Ansible Automation Platform (AAP): To align with governance and accountability objectives, acquiring Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) becomes imperative. At present, Norfolk Southern relies on a free, unsupported version of Ansible for automation, lacking centralized oversight and inhibiting the promotion of reuse. Transitioning to AAP allows oneself to establish a more cohesive/unified end-to-end platform, bolstering resilience plans, & allowing NS to integrate with the current technology footprint both on-prem and in the cloud.
* Additional OpenShift Subscriptions: Depending on the desired level of service resilience for mission-critical applications, more OpenShift capacity may be needed. This capacity would be determined by the criticality of the application workload and deployment model showcased above. 
* Red Hat Technical Account Management & Professional Services: To ensure the success of this project and the achievement of its goals, we recommend investing in support from dedicated Red Hat Technical Account Managers who will bring expertise to your teams & help you scale through implementation.
* Extended Life Support (ELS) for RHEL 7: Taking into account that we have a strategic partner who is both looking to advance their platform capabilities and has a difficult business situation currently, Red Hat wants to propose fully funding the ELS purchase for $375K and redirecting that capital to assist in moving NS forward on its resilience improvement plan. Essentially, Instead of buying time for migration around an old version of RHEL, we want to invest alongside you and put those dollars into achieving your resilience goals.
